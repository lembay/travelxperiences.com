<p><strong>A. Geological Significance</strong><br />Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon located near Page, Arizona, on Navajo land. Formed by the relentless forces of flash flooding and erosion, its narrow, winding passages and smooth, wave-like walls showcase the power of natural processes. The canyon is divided into two sections:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upper Antelope Canyon</strong>: Known as “Tse’ bighánílíní” (Navajo for “the place where water runs through rocks”), it’s famous for its iconic light beams and accessibility.  </li>
<li><strong>Lower Antelope Canyon</strong>: Called “Hasdestwazi” (“spiral rock arches”), it offers a more adventurous experience with staircases and ladders.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Cultural and Historical Context</strong><br />The canyon holds deep spiritual significance for the Navajo people, who have inhabited the region for centuries. Guided tours often include stories about Navajo history, traditions, and the canyon’s role in Indigenous culture.  </p>
