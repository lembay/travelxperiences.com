Antelope Canyon: Nature's Sculpted Masterpiece 

**A. Geological Significance**\
Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon located near Page, Arizona, on Navajo
land. Formed by the relentless forces of flash flooding and erosion, its
narrow, winding passages and smooth, wave-like walls showcase the power
of natural processes. The canyon is divided into two sections:

-   **Upper Antelope Canyon**: Known as "Tse' bighánílíní" (Navajo for
    "the place where water runs through rocks"), it's famous for its
    iconic light beams and accessibility.
-   **Lower Antelope Canyon**: Called "Hasdestwazi" ("spiral rock
    arches"), it offers a more adventurous experience with staircases
    and ladders.

 Cultural and Historical Context**\
The canyon holds deep spiritual significance for the Navajo people, who
have inhabited the region for centuries. Guided tours often include
stories about Navajo history, traditions, and the canyon's role in
Indigenous culture.
