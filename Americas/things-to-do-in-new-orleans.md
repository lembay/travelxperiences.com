Top Things to Do in New Orleans: Must-See Attractions and Hidden Gems 

Lost in New Orleans? 12 Must-Try Adventures Without Breaking the Bank  

New Orleans. It’s got jazz that’ll make your soul vibrate, food that could cure homesickness, streets packed with ghosts and stories older than your grandma’s recipes… but how do you even start? Planning a trip here? Let’s get honest: it’s easy to drown in options. Street parades, cemeteries where tombs look like dollhouses, bars older than your parents—where’s the best entry point? And let’s talk budget—can I enjoy this holy chaos *without* flashing credit cards like it’s Mardi Gras?  

Here’s what matters: a mix of iconic Nola moments, hidden gems that’ll make you feel like a local, and (yep) saving cash by booking tours via Viator. No tour buses, no overpriced trinkets—just a mix of beats, bites, and Black history done right.  

### **Iconic Nola: Distinguish the Must-Do’s**  

Start with the basics? Sure, but better still: skip the guesswork. Viator runs budget-friendly walking tours that hit all the high notes:  
- **French Quarter**: The Historic Vieux Carré. Don’t just wander—get a guide to decode pastel townhouses with secret courtyards (and the haunted ones).  
- **Jazz at Preservation Hall**: Snag a $50 ticket via Viator for a 50-minute piano-backed sermon of blues. The best seats *might* be the ones where you lose your backbone to the sound.  
- **Cafe du Monde**: Buy a beignet (not a beignet-and-soup combo). Dusted sugar is the only accessory needed here.  

Pro tip: Viator often tosses free New Orleans’ terminal shuttle rides with big bookings. Use this for last-minute Frenchmen Street bar hops.  

### **Food Combos to Fuel Your Exploring**  

Forget Michelin stars. This is a city that turns breakfast into an event, and lunch into *art*. Hit these without dropping GBP 20 a head:  
- **Lunch at Parkway Bakery**: The shrimp po’boy here ticks all boxes—crispy shell, less soggy than your undergrad pizza. Cotton shirts *required*.  
- **Dooky Chase**: Ever tried gumbo made by a Creole queen? Viator’s food tours give front-row seats to Lena Richard’s legacy.  
- **Snack crawl**: Grab a two-bite praline (Teri’s on the Riverwalk is solid) then duck into a local jazz club for a beer. No shame.  

**Viator hack**: Their food tour packages? You’ll save £30 on individual stops.  

### **Avoid “Tourist Trap” Fees: A Methode**  

NOLA’s gift to travelers? Pricey everything sounds “authentic.” Fight back:  
- **Bourbon Street bars**: Skip the overpriced mules. Cross the street toilded streets. Cross to Frenchmen Street. The live music’s louder, and beer’s cheaper at places like The Spotted Cat.  
- **Monuments**: The National WWII Museum? Buy a timed ticket via Viator for reserved entry (no end-of-day crowds). Or, pay £1 less with their Student Discount coupon.  
- **Cemetery photos**: No need to hire a photographer. The Cloisters (a.k.a. Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1) lets you snap pics for free. Built like Above Ground, below ground? Cool.  

### **Under-the-Radar Delights**  

Real locals don’t pine about the French Market or the St. Louis Cathedral. Break free:  
- **City Park**: Yep, a regular park… but the New Orleans Museum of Art’s sculpture garden is free on Wednesdays. Pair that with the park’s iconic “Moon Gate.”  
- **Tchoupitoulas Street murals**: Viator’s “Urban Art Walk” guide points out Banksy-esque street art you can’t miss.  
- **Bayou Trip**: Slime, Spanish moss, and… alligators cuddling (no joke)? Viator’s swamp tours are half the price of doing it alone, and your cousin can finally fake a Wikipedia photo for their FB.  

### **FAQs: Navigating Wrong Turns**  

**Q: What’s the best way to save on New Orleans tours?**  
A: Viator’s your best bet. They link local guides who skip the “ghost tour” fluff and get real (like why Lafitte’s Blacksmith was the city’s first Airbnb, minus Wi-Fi). Plus, their “Flex Ticket” lets you bank unused funds for tomorrow’s swamp adventure.  

**Q: How do I explore the Garden District Budget-Smart?**  
A: Pedal. Rent a bike from the localcréole Bike Rental (Viator’s partners offer 10% off) for £10 a day. Zigzag past antebellum mansions and snap pics from Audubon Park that don’t reek of “tourist.”  

**Q: Should I book a party riverboat?**  
A: Only if you’re into LASERS and $18 Bloody Marys. Instead, Viator’s “Bootlegger Experience” takes you to a riverfront speakeasy—think craft cocktails and history lessons on rumrunning. Cheaper than T-shirts at the gift shop.  

### **Peak Your Interest: Weekend Crash Courses**  

Day 1: Jazz + Ghosts + Beignets  
- 9 AM: Viator’s “French Quarter History Walk” (they’ll explain why vampires love above-ground tombs here).  
- 11 AM: Café du Monde beignets (add a café au lait, ignore the strangers who side-eye your mess).  
- 1 PM: Jazz at Frenchmen Street (no cover).  
- 6 PM: Viator’s “Spam Jam”—a drive to Pearl Street to taste Southern comfort food under £15 a plate.  

Day 2: Architecture + Food + Swampland  
- 8 AM: City Park’s sculpture garden + Freret Street brunch.  
- 2 PM: Viator’s swamp tour (you’ll learn why Louisianans think gumbo needs okra… or does it?).  
- 5 PM: Coney Island, yes the LA version, for a boardwalk burger.  

### **Tour Tips: Learn This Before You Die**  

- Double-check what’s “tourist” vs. “local.” Example: Emeril’s is on Yelp, but Grandma’s restaurant around the corner serves better jambalaya. Viator’s guides swear by it.  
- Wear breathable clothes. The humidity here is a “hardy perennial.”  
- Use streetcars for free rides? No. But Viator tour packages often come with transit vouchers.  
- Ask locals! The dude quoting Tennessee Williams at Preservation Hall? He’ll give great advice on where to drink.  

### **Wrap Up: Less Honey, More Verve**  

New Orleans? It’s a city that’s been perfecting the “messy vibe” since 1718. From neighborhood festivals happening for 72 hours to po’boys with *real* shrimp, it demands time—no checklists needed. Just roll with the rhythm, book local guides at Viator’s prices, and let the music do the teaching.  

After all, what’s a better Nola memory than stumbling upon a hidden blues bar, then realizing the only way to top it is… doing it all over again.  

Viator—because cruising Canal Street or dating a streetcar shouldn’t cost an arm and a leg.  

New Orleans—still uncovering itself, budget-friendly trip by budget-friendly trip.
